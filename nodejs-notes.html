what is node lts version
-----------------------------
LTS version is an abbreviation of the Long Time Support version where the release of the software is maintained for a more extended period of time. The LTS version is commonly recommended for most users. In Node. js, new versions frequently come with more features, optimized performance, and bug fixes

What do the numbers mean in a version number?
Reading version numbers
-----------------------------------------
For example: 1.2.3 These numbers have names. 
The leftmost number (1) is called the major version. 
The middle number (2) is called the minor version. 
The rightmost number (3) is called the revision but it may also be referred to as a "point release" or "subminor version"

<div>
What are semantic versioning rules?
Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)
-------------------------------------
Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. ...
A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes.


Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

	which core module in Node can you use to take advantage of multicore systems ?
	--------------------------------------------------------
	Node. js runs single threaded programming, which is very memory efficient, but to take advantage of computers multi-core systems, the Cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that each runs on their own single thread, to handle the load.

<div>
	Which DNS module method uses the underlying OS facilities and does not necessarily?
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	which library provides node.js with the event loop
	-----------------------------------------------------
	the libUV library

	The Event Loop was implemented to assist with the interactions between these asynchronous components and the main application thread. The Event loop is implemented as part of the libUV library that provides cross-platform asynchronous I/O in Node. js.
</div>

<div>
	What is the event loop in NodeJS?
	---------------------------------
	Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
